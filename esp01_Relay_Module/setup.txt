Components Needed:
ESP8266 Module
Arduino Uno
Breadboard (optional for easier connections)
Jumper Wires
Resistors (for voltage divider, if not using a level shifter)
USB Cable (to connect Arduino Uno to the computer)
Connections:
Power Connections:
Arduino 3.3V to ESP8266 VCC
Arduino GND to ESP8266 GND
Arduino 3.3V to ESP8266 CH_PD (or EN) (This enables the ESP8266)
Arduino GND to ESP8266 GPIO0 (For bootloader mode)
Communication Connections:
Arduino RX (Pin 0) to ESP8266 TX
Arduino TX (Pin 1) to ESP8266 RX (through a voltage divider or level shifter)
Voltage Divider (if not using a level shifter):
For the TX (Pin 1) on Arduino to RX on ESP8266:

Arduino TX (Pin 1) connects to a voltage divider made of two resistors (e.g., 1k立 and 2k立) before connecting to ESP8266 RX:
Connect a 2k立 resistor between Arduino TX and ESP8266 RX.
Connect a 1k立 resistor between ESP8266 RX and GND.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Set Up Connections:

Make the power and communication connections as described above.
Ensure the voltage divider is correctly set up if you're not using a level shifter.
Prepare the ESP8266 for Programming:

Connect GPIO0 to GND to put the ESP8266 in bootloader mode.
Upload Code Using Arduino Uno:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Select the correct board and port:
Go to Tools > Board and select Generic ESP8266 Module.
Go to Tools > Port and select the correct COM port.
Upload your code.
