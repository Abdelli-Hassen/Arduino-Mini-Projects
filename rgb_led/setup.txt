Components Needed:
Arduino
RGB LED module
Push button
Breadboard

1. Circuit Setup:

RGB LED Module:
Connect the Red pin of the RGB LED to digital pin 9 on the Arduino through a 220立 resistor.
Connect the Green pin of the RGB LED to digital pin 10 on the Arduino through a 220立 resistor.
Connect the Blue pin of the RGB LED to digital pin 11 on the Arduino through a 220立 resistor.
Connect the common cathode (GND) of the RGB LED to the GND on the Arduino.
Push Button:

Connect one side of the push button to 5V on the Arduino.
Connect the other side of the push button to digital pin 2 on the Arduino.
Place a pull-down resistor (10k立) between the push button pin connected to digital pin 2 and GND.
