Components Needed:
Arduino Uno or similar
Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05 or HC-06)
Relay module (make sure it's suitable for the voltage and current rating of your appliances)
LEDs (for status indication)
Push button (for manual control)
Resistors (220立 for LEDs, 10k立 for pull-down on the button)
Breadboard and connecting wires
Circuit Setup:
Bluetooth Module (HC-05 or HC-06):

Connect VCC to Arduino 5V.
Connect GND to Arduino GND.
Connect TXD to Arduino RX (via voltage divider if necessary).
Connect RXD to Arduino TX.
Relay Module:

Connect VCC of the relay module to Arduino 5V.
Connect GND of the relay module to Arduino GND.
Connect the input pin of the relay to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 7).
LEDs:

Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of each LED to GND through a 220立 resistor.
Connect the anode (longer leg) of each LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pins 8, 9, 10).
Push Button:

Connect one side of the push button to 5V on the Arduino.
Connect the other side to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 2).
Place a 10k立 pull-down resistor between the push button pin connected to the digital pin and GND.

Explanation:
Bluetooth Module Setup: Uses SoftwareSerial library to communicate with the Bluetooth module on pins 3 (RX) and 4 (TX).
Button Press Handling: Toggles the relay state (HIGH/LOW) when the push button is pressed.
Bluetooth Commands: Listens for commands ('1', '2', '3', '0') sent from a Bluetooth terminal (like an app on your smartphone).
'1', '2', '3' turn on respective LEDs.
'0' turns off all LEDs.
Usage:
Upload the Code: Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.
Connect Bluetooth: Pair your smartphone with the Bluetooth module (HC-05/HC-06).
Control LEDs and Relay:
Use a Bluetooth terminal app on your smartphone to send commands ('1', '2', '3', '0') to control LEDs.
Press the push button to toggle the relay (simulate appliance control).
